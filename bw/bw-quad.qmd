Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}

  mutate(half_decades = cut(year, breaks = seq(1969, 2014, by = 5)))
```

```{r, fig.cap = "Created by Madeleine Heafey"}
