    "text": "Exercise 1: Research Questions\nLet’s dig into the hikes data, starting with the elevation and difficulty ratings of the hikes:\n\nhead(hikes)\n\n             peak elevation difficulty ascent length time    rating\n1     Mt. Marcy        5344          5   3166   14.8 10.0  moderate\n2 Algonquin Peak       5114          5   2936    9.6  9.0  moderate\n3   Mt. Haystack       4960          7   3570   17.8 12.0 difficult\n4   Mt. Skylight       4926          7   4265   17.9 15.0 difficult\n5 Whiteface Mtn.       4867          4   2535   10.4  8.5      easy\n6       Dix Mtn.       4857          5   2800   13.2 10.0  moderate\n\n\n\nWhat features would we like a visualization of the categorical difficulty rating variable to capture? #The relative frequency of the different difficulties\nWhat about a visualization of the quantitative elevation variable? #Some kind of visual comparison between their values\nExercise 2: Load tidyverse\nWe’ll address the above questions using ggplot tools. Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\n# Use the ggplot function\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. We’ve installed the package but we need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe?\n\nggplot created a blank chart\n\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function?\n\nthe name of the data\n\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating?\n\nto specify which variable we want to work with\n\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!?\n\naesthetic\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\n# The plot now has a coordinate system and the data is visible\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The axes have labels now\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The bars are now blue!\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The bars are now blue with an orange outline\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The background color of the plot has been changed\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\nPart a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it?\n\nWe use it to add more features to the plots\n\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”?\n\nBecause the bars are geometric elements we are adding\n\nWhat does labs() stand for?\n\nLabels\n\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill?\n\nColor changes the outline color, fill changes the fill color\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe? # Difficulty of the hikes\n\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others? # Moderate is more common than Easy or Difficult\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\nEasy, Moderate, and Difficult are not in a logical order\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)?\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\n\n#This is not an effective visualization for the elevation variable since it doesn't give a good sense of distribution or outliers\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?\n\n6 hikes\n\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?\n\n4 hikes\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.\nWe learned that the histogram is skewed right, with the center of the data points being clummped around 4400 feet. The minimum is 3700 feet and the maximum is 5500 feet. There are no outliers.\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\n# A histogram of the elevation data was created\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The bars now have a white outline\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The bars now have a blue fill\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The bars no longer have a blue fill and the axis labels have been clarified\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The bin size has been made way bigger\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The bin size has been made way smaller\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The bin size is now normal (200)\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry?\n\ngeom_histogram()\n\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill?\n\ncolor changes the outline color, while fill changes the fill color\n\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization?\n\nIt makes the bars pop more!\n\nWhat did binwidth do?\n\nChanges the width of the bin\n\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)?\n\nIt becomes impossible to see any meaningful trends in the data\n\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)?\n\nIt’s still impossible to see any meaningful trends in the data\nExercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\")\n\nThis will probably turn the line blue\n\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\nThis will probably turn the area under the line orange\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#yes!\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range?\n\nIt gives us a better sense of the variability and shape of elevations since the data isn’t sorted into bins like in the histogram.\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each?\n\nSince the histogram is sorted into bins it’s easy to get a sense of how much data is in any specific range, but the shape of the data can be unclear depending on the size of the bins.\nThe density plot gives a really good picture of the distribution of the data, but it’s hard to see exactly how many data points there are at a certain elevation or any outliers.\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why?\nIt makes the code a lot more readable, since it’s clear that the ggplot is the thing being modified\n\n\n# YUCK\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why?\nIt breaks up the modifications to make it easir to see what’s happening to the plot\n\n\n# YUCK \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14: Practice\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\nggplot(survey, aes(x = minutes_to_campus)) + \n  geom_density() + \n  labs(x = \"Minutes to campus\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(survey, aes(x = minutes_to_campus)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"black\", binwidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Minutes to campus\", y = \"Number of students\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nggplot(world_cup, aes(x = attendance)) + \n  geom_density() + \n  labs(x = \"Attendance\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(world_cup, aes(x = attendance)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"black\", binwidth = 250000) +\n  labs(x = \"Game attendance\", y = \"Number of games\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck → Commit → Push\n\n\n\nWhen done, don’t forgot to click Render Book and check the resulting HTML files.

Let’s wrangle our data first.\nWe’ll focus on just a few variables of interest, and create a new variable (repub_20_categories) that discretizes the repub_pct_20 variable into increments of 5 percentage points (for states) or 10 percentage points (for counties):\n\n# Don't worry about the code!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- elections_by_state |&gt; \n  filter(state_abbr != \"DC\") |&gt; \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, repub_pct_20) |&gt; \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(30, 70, by = 5), \n               labels = c(\"30-34\", \"35-39\", \"40-44\", \"45-49\",\n                          \"50-54\", \"55-59\", \"60-64\", \"65-70\"), \n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties |&gt; \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, county_name, county_fips,\n          repub_pct_20, median_age, median_rent) |&gt; \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n               labels = c(\"0-9\", \"10-19\", \"20-29\", \"30-39\", \"40-49\",\n                          \"50-59\", \"60-69\", \"70-79\", \"80-89\", \"90-100\"),\n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\n# Add 0's at the beginning of any fips_code that's fewer than 5 numbers long\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties |&gt; \n  mutate(county_fips = as.character(county_fips)) |&gt; \n  mutate(county_fips = \n           ifelse(nchar(county_fips) == 4, paste0(\"0\", county_fips), county_fips))\n\nExercise 8: State-level choropleth maps\nPart d\ngeom_map()\nExercise 10: Play around!\n\nggplot(elections_by_counties, aes(map_id = county_fips, fill = median_rent)) +\n  geom_map(map = county_map) +\n  expand_limits(x = county_map$long, y = county_map$lat) +\n  theme_map() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") + \n  coord_equal() + \n  scale_fill_gradientn(name = \"median rent\", colors = c(\"white\", \"lightgreen\", \"darkgreen\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(elections_by_counties, aes(map_id = county_fips, fill = median_age)) +\n  geom_map(map = county_map) +\n  expand_limits(x = county_map$long, y = county_map$lat) +\n  theme_map() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") + \n  coord_equal() + \n  scale_fill_gradientn(name = \"median age\", colors = terrain.colors(10))",

Thoughts?\nIn the toolbar at the top of this document, Render the .qmd file into a .html file. Where is this file stored? Thoughts about its appearance / contents? Can you edit it?\nToggling between the .qmd and .html files, explain the purpose of the following features in the .qmd file:\n*\n**\n#\n-\n\\\n![](url)\n\n\n12 Exercise 2: Code\nHow does this appear in the .qmd?
